# Triangle 4.0

Triangle Site 4.0 is the new version of Triangle's site which includes a major redesign in the site's design, and has had tons of interactivity and responsiveness added to it.

## The new concept

Last version of the Triangle Site (which can be viewed <a href="https://triangle-mx.github.io/Triangle-3.0">here</a>) was kind of **monotonous** and **boring**, that is why we decided to redesign completely it.

The new concept is more **human**, more **personal**. We don't want to be seen like <i>machines doing websites</i>, but instead we want to be look like <i>humans helping businesses, organizations and other projects to get awesome websites</i>.

The redesign includes subtle **animations**, which will help us to create a more **human** look.

## Accesibility

To get a **human** look, we need to make our site more accessible. We are going to make this in three different ways:

- **Colorblindness Filters**: Thanks to Github User <a href="https://github.com/Altreus">Altreus</a> we managed to get some filters for people with eight different types of color blindness. To access this filters you just need to click on the eye icon at the footer of each page.

- **Ultra Responsiveness**: Nearly 60% percent of our CSS code is dedicating to make out page mobile friendly and ultra responsive.

- **Fast Loading**: The site is ultra fast and runs smoothly thanks to some JavaScript tweaks and minimized files (It even loads faster than Google when tested on certain servers).
