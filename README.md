# Triangle 4.0

Triangle Site v4.0 is the new version of Triangle's site wich includes a major redesign in the site's design, and has had tons of interactivity and responsiveness added to it.

## The new concept

Last version of the Triangle Site (wich can be viewed at https://triangle-mx.github.io/Triangle-3.0) was kind of **monotonous** and **boring**, that is why we decided to redesign completely it.

The new concept is more **human**, more **personal**. We donÂ´t want to be seen like <i>machines doing websites</i>, but instead we want to be look like <i>humans helping businesses, organizations and other projects to get awesome websites</i>.

The redesign includes subtle **animations**, wich will help to create a more **human** look.
