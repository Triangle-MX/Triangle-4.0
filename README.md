The new version of our site which includes a major redesign in the site's design, and has had tons of interactivity and responsiveness added to it. Built with <a href="https://github.com/Triangle-MX/Parsec">Parsec</a> and secured with JScrambler.

## The new concept

Last version of the Triangle Site (which can be viewed <a href="https://triangle-mx.github.io/Triangle-3.0">here</a>) was kind of **monotonous**, **boring**, and **slow**, that is why we decided to redesign completely it.

The new concept is more **human**, more **personal**. We don't want to be seen like <i>machines doing websites</i>, but instead we want to be look like <i>humans helping businesses, organizations and other projects to get awesome websites</i>.

The redesign includes subtle **animations**, which will help us to create a more **human** look. It is also **blazing-fast** thanks to the new **Netlify** hosting solution *and* Content Delivery Network (CDN).

## Accesibility

To get a near perfect **human** look, we need to make our site more accessible. We are going to make this in three different ways:

- **Ultra Responsiveness**: Nearly 60% percent of our CSS code is dedicating to make out page mobile friendly and ultra responsive.

- **Blazing-Fast Loading**: The site is ultra fast and runs smoothly thanks to some JavaScript tweaks and minimized files (It even loads faster than Google when tested on certain servers). Also, the site runs on **Netlify's CDN**.
