# Triangle 4.0

Triangle Site 4.0 is the new version of Triangle's site wich includes a major redesign in the site's design, and has had tons of interactivity and responsiveness added to it.

## The new concept

Last version of the Triangle Site (wich can be viewed <a href="https://triangle-mx.github.io/Triangle-3.0" target="_blank">here</a>) was kind of **monotonous** and **boring**, that is why we decided to redesign completely it.

The new concept is more **human**, more **personal**. We don't want to be seen like <i>machines doing websites</i>, but instead we want to be look like <i>humans helping businesses, organizations and other projects to get awesome websites</i>.

The redesign includes subtle **animations**, wich will help to create a more **human** look.

## Accesibility

To get a **human** look, we need to make our site more accesible. We are going to make this in three different ways:

- **Colorblindness Filters**: Thanks to Github User <a href="https://github.com/Altreus" target="_blank">Altreus</a> we managed to get some filters por people with eight different types of color blindness. To access this filters you just need to click on the eye icon at the footer of each page.

- **Ultra Responsiveness**: Nearly 60% percent of our CSS code is dedicating to make out page mobile friendly and ultra responsive.

- **Fast Loading**: The site is ultra fast and runs smoothly thanks to some JavaScript tweaks.

## Easter Eggs

The new version of the site includes several easter eggs:

- Taxi (13" Macbooks | Other 1440px wide screens): When you click it a Horn sound plays.
- Roger-Roger (All devices): When you click the icon of the FAQ section (on the <code>index.html</code> file), it makes the "Roger-Roger" sound from Star Wars.
